  Plan the user's Instagram week: how many posts they can really make, the format and subject of each, the call to action and the Saypage page or automation behind it, daily stories and time for comments. Built from their recent posts and insights when Saypage is connected. Use for requests like "what do I post this week", "make me a posting schedule", "I'm out of ideas", "organise my Instagram for November".

# Content calendar

A plan the user can keep beats an ambitious one they drop on Wednesday. This skill decides
what to make; the other skills write it.

## 1. Start from what is true

With Saypage connected (call `get_account` first):

- `list_instagram_posts`: the last four weeks of posts, their formats and topics, so the
  plan does not repeat a theme from last week.
- `get_instagram_insights` over 28 days, with `demographics: true` when the account has 100
  followers or more: the countries tell you which time zone to plan in.
- `list_automations` and `get_page_stats`: which keywords already run, and which pages
  people visit.
- If `performance-review` ran in this conversation, its findings outrank every default
  below.

Then ask, in one message:

1. What is happening this week: a launch, a new dish, an event, a result, a lesson, a
   customer story. A week's news gives better posts than any idea list.
2. What they want from Instagram right now: new followers, visits, bookings, sales, DMs.
3. How many posts they can realistically make: be honest, two good ones beat five rushed.

## 2. The mix

Give each post one job, and vary them across the week:

| Job | Usual format | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Discover** | Reel | brings in viewers new to the account |
| **Useful** | carousel or Reel | gets saved and sent: recipes, steps, tips |
| **Trust** | Reel, photo or stories | the person, the place, the process, behind the scenes |
| **Offer** | carousel, Reel or stories | what they sell, said plainly, with the keyword or link |

A week of three posts might be Discover, Useful, Offer, with stories every day.

Give each post a precise subject the user could film tomorrow: "the €4 dinner I make when
the shop closes late" rather than "pasta".

## 3. Wire each post to Saypage

- **The ask**: when a post promises something to send, give it a keyword and say which page
  it sends (an existing one from `list_pages`, or one to build with the `saypage` skill).
- **The automation**: note which ones to create and on which post. Check the plan's limits
  in `get_account` before promising one on every post; the free plan runs one automation.
- **The bio**: if the plan pushes people to the bio link, make sure it leads to a page
  that matches the offer (`profile-review`).

## 4. When to post

Use the audience's time zone, from the demographics when available. Pick moments when
they browse (commutes, lunch, evenings for most people), check the guess against the
user's own best posts, and then keep a steady rhythm. If the user spends more time on the
hour than on the opening of their Reels, steer them back: a weak opening loses more than
an odd hour.

Saypage has no scheduler: it publishes when the user asks. The plan says when to come back
("Tuesday 6 pm: publish the gnocchi Reel"), or the user posts from the app.

## 5. Around the posts

- **Stories**: daily, three to six frames (`story-sequence`).
- **Comments**: 15 minutes after each post to answer the first comments
  (`comment-replies`), and 10 to 15 minutes a day commenting on other accounts
  (`engagement-comments`).

## Output

```
WEEK OF 2 NOVEMBER  ·  3 posts  ·  audience mostly in France (Europe/Paris)

TUE 18:30  REEL      Discover  "I salted pasta water wrong for ten years"   ask: follow
THU 12:00  CAROUSEL  Useful    5 weeknight sauces, 10 minutes each           ask: Comment SAUCES -> sauces page (to build)
SAT 10:00  REEL      Offer     Sunday cooking class, 6 seats left            ask: Comment CLASS -> booking page (live)

STORIES   every day; poll on Wednesday, class countdown from Thursday
COMMENTS  15 min after each post; 10 min a day on other accounts

To do with Saypage: build the sauces page, then an automation on Thursday's post.
```

Then offer to write the first post ("write Tuesday"), one at a time with `reel-script`,
`carousel-post` or `instagram-caption`.
